        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello, my name is Amanda. I am a graduate of the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), with a BFA in Design and a BA in Media & Communications.</p>
            <p>I am a serial enthusiast and I love to learn new things. My current obsessions surround researching and creating historical fashion and costumery and studying small-scale, sustainable architecture. I also love to sing and enjoy learning to play new instruments. My employers, professors, and peers know me to work efficiently, value constructive criticism, and face any and all challenges with an open mind and eager attitude.</p>
